# DevSkiller-Mindera-SpaceX

Requirements

Must have
UI

Must be implemented in UIKit (no SwiftUI for now)
Should be memory efficient
Should include filters and launch details, for more details see the image below in Build this


Network Layer

Use the SpaceX API documented here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs
The "Company Info" endpoint returns the data for the section at the top of the screen, while the "All launches" endpoint returns the data for the rest of the list
Implement the necessary logic to perform the API requests for fetching the company, launches and images

Parsing

Implement the necessary logic to perform the API response parsing

Unit Tests

Your code should ideally have unit tests or at least be easily testable

Version Control

The app should be under a git repository.

Nice to have (Extras)

Note: This is not required, you can do it if you have time.

Infinite scrolling
Offline mode (use any existent images from a previous run, if no network available)
Caching (cache response data to avoid hitting the network every time)
Certificate pinning
Dark/light mode
